# 1. Designing a rule-based Expert System
## Problem Description
    To design a rule based Expert System capable of learning, deduction and explaining rulesets and designing a suitable console to use the system from the terminal
## Formal Problem Statement
- ### Purpose:
    To compute and show results from what was learned.
- ### Input / The data: 
    The data required to create such a Expert System consists of:
    - **A rulebase** containing general knowledge about the problem domain.
    - **Global Database** containing the facts or assertions about the particular problem being solved
    - **Parameters** provided by the user for computation.
- ### Features:
    The program aims to feature a interactive console which would enable the program to gather information and print results. Queries such as what rule was used and why a rule is legal will be available.

# 2. AI Modelling
    The program uses generalized heuristic reasoning to deduce the applicable rules and compute and display results for the queries made by the user.
